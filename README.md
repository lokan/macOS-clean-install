# macOS-clean-install
Simple script allowing me to fully configure macOS after a clean install.

**⚠️ This script is based on my needs only. ⚠️**
**⚠️ I am not a developper and I am merely trying to do something functionnal. ⚠️**
**⚠️ So please, don't trust anything, and be careful. ⚠️**

 This project is based on the really good idea of ([nicolinuxfr](https://github.com/nicolinuxfr/macOS-post-installation/)).

 You should go there and take a look.
