# macOS-clean-install
Simple script allowing me to fully configure macOS after a clean install.

**⚠️ These scripts are based on my needs only. ⚠️**<br />
**⚠️ I am not a developper and I am merely trying to do something functionnal. ⚠️**<br />
**⚠️ So please, don't trust anything, and be careful. ⚠️**<br />

This project is based on the really good idea of [nicolinuxfr](https://github.com/nicolinuxfr/macOS-post-installation/).
Thanks to [joeyhoer](https://github.com/joeyhoer/starter) who listed (almost) every command line available.

## Work in progress

**Careful. This is a work in progress. Scripts are not usable yet.**<br />
If your trying to find a ready-to-use solution, you are in the wrong place.

## How to execute scripts

Before launching a script, you should be sure that it is executable.
You may have a "zsh: permission denied" in Terminal.app

To fix this, use "chmod +x" on your script.
